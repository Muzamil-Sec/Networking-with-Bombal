#Topics coverd in this files are
1: Build your first network with Packet Tracer
2: Configure Ip Addresses with switch & and other devices and server also
3: Web search through the pc1&pc2 to web servers
4: Configure switch with some commands and ARP 


---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- : )

Day02:
1: Creating two networks connecting them with the switech and then to the router 
and the router will be connected to the Internet and we are accessing the servers from the other side of 
the network like cisco server facebook server etc

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------:  )
Day03: Binary Numbers
Binary numbers are the numbers that only understand by the computer 0 1 form
0=off
1= ON
no current in wire its 0 and if the current flows through the line its 1
Table i used to convert an IP address to Binary is:

2^7 | 2^6 | 2^5 | 2^4 | 2^3 | 2^2 | 2^1 | 2^0 |
128 | 64  | 32  | 16  | 8   | 4   | 2   | 1   |

Lets take an ip address then convert it:

192.168.1.100

There are four octets in the IPv4 address each address has 8 bits 8x4=32 bits
IPv4 is 32 bits long : )

192-128=64 , 64-32=16, 16-8=8, 8-4=4, 4-4=0;
128=1
64=1
32=1
16=1
8=1
4=1
That's mean for 192 the binary number is = 11111100

same with the 168, 1 and 100
This is called subneeting : )
